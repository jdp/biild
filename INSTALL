Ioke doesn't really have a decent package manager yet (cane is still under
development, I guess) so you might have to manually install Biild. It is
really easy though, I promise. Just make a simple shell script somewhere
in your PATH. I actually have ~/bin in my PATH for simple things like this.

Enter this into a shell script:

    #!/bin/sh
    ioke /path/to/biild.ik $*

Call it biild and then run:

    $ chmod u+x biild

All done. I think.
