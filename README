:: Biild :: A very tiny build system ::

  Biild is a build system modeled after
Ruby Rake and built in the Ioke language.

:: How to Use ::

  When Biild is run, it looks for a script
called a Biildfile in the current directory.
It can be called any of these things:

  Biildfile
  Biildfile.ik
  biildfile
  biildfile.ik
  
  The first one that matches will be found
and loaded.

:: The Biildfile ::

  Biildfiles are actually a simple DSL
interpreter that tasks are defined inside
of. A simple task looks like this:

  task(:bloop,
      "Inside the bloop task!" println
      true
  )
  
  Then when Biild is run, like this:
  
  $ biild bloop
  
  The bloop task will be executed.
  
  Tasks can also be namespaced, allowing
related tasks to be grouped together.

  namespace(:sounds,
  	  task(:buzz,
  	      "bzzzzzzzzzzzzz" println
  	  )
  	  task(:hum,
  	      "H M M M M M M" println
  	  )
  )
  
  Namespace nesting isn't limited,
namespaces can be multiple levels deep.
To access a namespaced task, use the
convention namespace:task, i.e.:

  $ biild sounds:buzz
